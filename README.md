# SerrverHitsApp
# Server API Hits Dashboard Project

This project is a full-stack web application that displays API hits for two different servers (`112` and `113`). It provides a user-friendly dashboard with filtering options, a refresh button, and the ability to handle data from both live APIs and fallback dummy data. Below is the detailed documentation for the project.

### **Features**
- Displays server hits with total hits, successful hits, and failed hits.
- Dynamic filtering options based on date and time.
- Refresh button to reload the data.
- Fallback mechanism to display dummy data in case the API fails.
